    "description": "Published two weeks after his seventieth birthday, Ada, or Ardor is one of Nabokov's greatest masterpieces, the glorious culmination of his career as a novelist.\u00a0\u00a0It tells a love story troubled by incest.\u00a0But more: it is also at once a fairy tale, epic, philosophical treatise on the nature of time, parody of the history of the novel, and erotic catalogue. Ada, or Ardor is no less than the superb work of an imagination at white heat.\n\nThis is the first American edition to include the extensive and ingeniously\u00a0sardonic appendix by the author, written under the anagrammatic pseudonym Vivian Darkbloom.",
